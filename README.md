# Imp-006-Project-Box
Modular box for Electric Imp 006 breakout board and add-ons.

The Imp006 breakout board offers world-class security and ubiquitous connectivity, including cellular data starting at $3 per month that can be turned off and on again to avoid connectivity charges.  It has GPS, Glonass, Galileo, Beidu/Compass, & QZSS positioning, as well as dual-band WiFi, and BLE networking.  i2c, Mikro Bus and 8 UART connections are available as well as a GPIO connector. See https://www.electricimp.com/imp006-breakout/ for full documentation.

There are two different box lids available.  The two-piece lid that involves a color change, or a one-piece blank lid. All of the provided STLs print without supports.

The box design acommodates the use of “mezzanine” expansion layers that stack between the box and the lid.  A mezzanine layer with prototyping breadboards is forthcoming.

The OpenSCAD file requires the BOSL2 library, see https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2. Full BOSL2 documentiation with copius examples is at https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2/wiki. 

The OpenSCAD file can render all of the STLs with the Customizer allowing custom tweaks.

The Antenna Plate STL is included to allow mounting the adhesive-backed cellular antenna, although use of the part is optional.  You can simply slip the antenna with the adhesive backing paper attached into the antenna slot in the box.  I don't recommend sticking the antenna to the box as that makes moving the antenna to a different (improved?) box in the future more difficult.
